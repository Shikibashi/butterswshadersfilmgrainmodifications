Changes i have made to [buttersw filmgrain shaders filmgrain1 and grain](https://github.com/butterw/bShaders)

I used Asmodians Max Settings in Madvr, you can reset madvr easily to use these settings by putting settings.bin and restore default settings.bat in the same directory as madvr, you run the batch file and there you now have the Asmodian Settings

I use filmgrain1 as the first pre-resize shader in mpchc, the second shader being used is grain

I use grain as the first post resize shader in mpchc, the second shader being used is filmgrain1

Depending on Content resolution being watched it may be worth it to upscale only 2x, so for 480 upscale to 720p, rather than upscaling to 4k, for 720p upscaling to 1440p, for 1080p upscaling to 2160p // This works well for post resize shaders. Will get test pictures soon.
