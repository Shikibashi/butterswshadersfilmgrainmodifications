Changes i have made to buttersw filmgrain shaders filmgrain1 and grain https://github.com/butterw/bShaders

I used Asmodeans Max Settings in Madvr

I use filmgrain1 as the first pre-resize shader in mpchc, the second shader being used is grain

I use grain as the first post resize shader in mpchc, the second shader being used is filmgrain1
